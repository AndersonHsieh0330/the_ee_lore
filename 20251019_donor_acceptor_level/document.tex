	\section{Intrinsic Semiconductor Baseline}
	In a pure (intrinsic) semiconductor such as silicon:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The valence band is completely filled with electrons.
		\item The conduction band is empty at \(0\,\text{K}\).
		\item The bandgap \(E_g = E_c - E_v \approx 1.1\,\text{eV}\).
	\end{itemize}
	Electrons must be thermally excited across this gap to contribute to conduction, which is inefficient at low temperature. Doping introduces shallow energy levels to make this process easier.
	
	\section{Donor Levels (n-Type Doping)}
	When a donor atom such as phosphorus is introduced into silicon:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Phosphorus has five valence electrons; four form covalent bonds, leaving one extra electron.
		\item This extra electron is weakly bound to the donor atom, creating a discrete energy level slightly below the conduction band edge \(E_c\).
		\item This state, called the \textbf{donor level} \(E_d\), is where the donor electron \textbf{sits before ionization}.
		\item The \textbf{donor ionization energy} is the small energy needed to free that electron into the conduction band:
		\[
		E_c - E_d \approx 50\,\text{meV}.
		\]
	\end{itemize}
	At room temperature, \(kT \approx 25\,\text{meV}\), so most donor electrons are thermally ionized, producing free conduction electrons and resulting in \textbf{n-type conductivity}.
	
	\section{Acceptor Levels (p-Type Doping)}
	When an acceptor atom such as boron is introduced:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Boron has only three valence electrons and can accept one electron from a neighboring Si bond.
		\item This creates a \textbf{hole} in the valence band and an \textbf{acceptor level} \(E_a\) just above the valence band edge \(E_v\).
		\item The \textbf{acceptor level} represents the energy state the captured electron occupies \textbf{before ionization}, i.e., before the hole is freed into the valence band.
		\item The \textbf{acceptor ionization energy} is the energy required to excite a valence electron into the acceptor level:
		\[
		E_a - E_v \approx 50\,\text{meV}.
		\]
	\end{itemize}
	This process generates holes in the valence band, giving the material \textbf{p-type conductivity}.
	
	\section{Energy-Level Diagram}
	Figure~\ref{fig:donor_acceptor} illustrates these energy levels schematically.

			The donor electron initially occupies the donor level \(E_d\), located just below the conduction band edge \(E_c\). 
			Ionizing the donor requires an energy \(E_c - E_d\) to lift this electron into the conduction band. 
			Similarly, an acceptor level \(E_a\) lies just above the valence band \(E_v\); before ionization, it can capture an electron from the valence band, leaving behind a mobile hole.}

	\section{Where Conduction Occurs}
	A key distinction between n-type and p-type semiconductors is \textbf{which band} supports carrier motion:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In \textbf{n-type} material, conduction occurs in the \textbf{conduction band}.\\
		Donor electrons are easily excited from \(E_d\) to \(E_c\), where they move freely as conduction-band electrons.
		\item In \textbf{p-type} material, conduction occurs in the \textbf{valence band}.\\
		When an acceptor captures an electron from the valence band, it leaves a hole behind. 
		That hole can move through the valence band as neighboring electrons fill it---the holes are the actual mobile charge carriers.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Summary}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Donor level:} Shallow energy level introduced by a donor atom, typically \(E_d \approx 50\,\text{meV}\) below \(E_c\). The donor electron resides here \emph{before ionization}.
		\item \textbf{Acceptor level:} Shallow energy level introduced by an acceptor atom, typically \(E_a \approx 50\,\text{meV}\) above \(E_v\). It represents the bound state of the captured electron before the hole is freed.
		\item In n-type semiconductors, conduction occurs through electrons in the conduction band.
		\item In p-type semiconductors, conduction occurs through holes in the valence band.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent
	\textbf{In one sentence:} 
	Dopant atoms create shallow electronic states within the bandgap---just below \(E_c\) for donors or just above \(E_v\) for acceptors---and the small ionization energy ($\sim50$\,meV) frees carriers into their respective bands: electrons into the conduction band (n-type) and holes into the valence band (p-type).
